## Development Process

### Branch Naming

- Feature branches: `feature/description-of-feature`
- Bug fix branches: `fix/description-of-fix`
- Documentation branches: `docs/description-of-change`

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that don't affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - A code change that improves performance
- `test:` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat: add webhook retry configuration
fix: prevent duplicate webhook deliveries
docs: update API documentation for endpoints
```

### Code Style

- We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Run `pnpm lint` to check your code
- Run `pnpm format` to format your code
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Run `pnpm test` to run all tests
- Run `pnpm test:watch` during development
- Aim for good test coverage

### Documentation

- Update the README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments to exported functions and classes
- Update API documentation for endpoint changes
- Include examples in your documentation

## Database Changes

When making database schema changes:

1. Create a new migration: `pnpm db:migrate dev`

3. Generate the Prisma client: `pnpm db:generate`
4. Test migrations both up and down
5. Update seed data if necessary
